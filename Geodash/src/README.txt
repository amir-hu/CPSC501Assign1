To compile and run this program, first extract the folder "Geometry Dash" from the zip file given.  
Next, change directories to the "Geometry Dash" folder and compile each package using the command line "javac gui/*.java" to compile the gui package, and "javac logic/*.java" to compile the logic package. 
*Make sure the two .png files - Player and Spike - and the README file are in the "Geometry Dash" folder but not in the "gui" or "logic" folders. 
To run the game, use the command line "java gui/Main". 

Instructions on how to play are displayed in the top left hand corner of the game.   

Note: The game occasionally freezes at the start of the program. To fix this, either directly run it again using "java gui/Main" or re-compile and run it again.
